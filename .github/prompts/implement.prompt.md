Implement the requested changes following the safety-first protocol:

1. Read and understand relevant files before writing code
2. Check `docs/solutions/` for past learnings
3. Apply the safety checklist to every function (null, empty, boundary, error handling, input validation)
4. Write tests covering happy path, null inputs, empty collections, boundary values, and error cases
5. Run security check before considering complete
6. Validate with tests and linting

If there's a plan in `docs/plans/`, follow its implementation steps.
