Capture a solved problem as a reusable solution document in `docs/solutions/`.

1. **Identify the learning** — what problem was solved? What was tricky about it?
2. **Check for duplicates** — search `docs/solutions/` for existing docs on this topic
3. **Create solution doc** — include:
   - Problem description
   - Root cause
   - Solution with code examples
   - Gotchas and edge cases
   - Tags for future searchability
4. **Save** to `docs/solutions/YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name.md`

This enables future sessions to learn from past work instead of solving the same problems again.
