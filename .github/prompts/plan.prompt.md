argument-hint: "feature or change to plan"
---

Create a structured implementation plan for the requested change. Research the codebase first, determine the right plan tier (minimal/standard/comprehensive), and include spec-flow analysis for non-trivial work.

Present the plan for my explicit acceptance before saving. Do NOT proceed without my approval.
