**Prerequisites:**
- Fresh Eyes Review APPROVED

## Invocation

**Interactive mode:**
User types `/commit-and-pr` with no arguments. Claude asks for confirmation and base branch.

**Direct mode:**
User types `/commit-and-pr --base experimental` to specify base branch.

## Arguments

- `--message "[message]"` - Custom commit message (optional, auto-generated if not provided)

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Verify prerequisites

**Check Fresh Eyes Review status:**
- Look for Fresh Eyes verdict in conversation history
- Verify: APPROVED or APPROVED_WITH_NOTES
- If not found or not approved:
  ```
  ⚠️  Fresh Eyes Review not completed or not approved!

  Run Fresh Eyes Review first: `/fresh-eyes-review`

  Current status: [BLOCK | FIX_BEFORE_COMMIT | Not run]

  Bypass and commit anyway? (yes/no): _____
  ```

**Check tests passing:**
- Look for validation status in conversation history
- Verify: VALIDATION_PASSED
- If not found:
  ```
  ⚠️  Validation not completed!

  Run validation first: `/run-validation`

  Bypass and commit anyway? (yes/no): _____
  ```

**Check staged changes:**
```bash
git diff --staged --name-only
```

**If no staged changes:**
```
⚠️  No staged changes found!

Stage your changes:
  git add .

Then run: `/commit-and-pr`
```
