description: Review the AI Coding Agent Protocol and confirm compliance
---

Read and internalize the guidelines from `../AI_CODING_AGENT_GODMODE.md`.

Then provide a brief status report:

1. **Current Phase:** What phase of work are we in? (Phase 0: Planning, Phase 1: Execution, Phase 2: Finalization)

2. **Protocol Compliance:**
   - Am I exploring before proposing solutions?
   - Am I using extended thinking for complex decisions?
   - Am I providing confidence indicators with my status updates?
   - Am I flagging risks appropriately?
   - Am I being direct and not a yes-man?

3. **Next Action:** What approval or input is needed to proceed?

4. **Blockers:** Are there any `HALT_PENDING_DECISION` items?

Confirm you are following the protocol, then continue with the current task.
