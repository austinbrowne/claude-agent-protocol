# GitHub Project Integration Guide

**Version:** 1.0
**Purpose:** Integrate GODMODE workflow with GitHub Projects for issue-driven development

---

## Overview

After plan approval in Phase 0, issues are automatically created in GitHub and added to a GitHub Project board. Claude Code can then pick issues from the board or be assigned via @mentions.

---

## Setup (One-Time)

### 1. Authenticate with Project Scope

```bash
# Required for project access
gh auth refresh -s project

# Verify authentication
gh auth status
```

### 2. Create GitHub Project (if needed)

```bash
# Create new project
gh project create --owner OWNER --title "AI Development Board"

# Or link existing project to repo
# Projects are automatically linked when you add repo issues to them
```

### 3. Identify Your Target Project

```bash
# List all projects and note the TITLE for the one you want
gh project list --owner OWNER

# Example output:
# 3  Claude Agent Protocol         open  PVT_kwHOBGF6h84BJbD_
# 2  Small Business Automation     open  PVT_kwHOBGF6h84BJbAN

# IMPORTANT: Use the exact project TITLE in --project flag
# This ensures issues go to the intended project board
# Note: The number shown is for reference only; use the title in commands
```

### 4. Verify Current Repo

```bash
# Check current repository
gh repo view

# View linked projects (JSON format)
gh repo view --json projectsV2
```

---

## Standard Label System

### Recommended Labels (based on 2025 best practices)

Create these labels in your repository:

```bash
# Type labels (what kind of work)
gh label create "type: bug" --description "Something isn't working" --color "d73a4a"
gh label create "type: feature" --description "New feature or request" --color "a2eeef"
gh label create "type: enhancement" --description "Improvement to existing feature" --color "84b6eb"
gh label create "type: docs" --description "Documentation only changes" --color "0075ca"
gh label create "type: refactor" --description "Code refactoring" --color "fbca04"
gh label create "type: test" --description "Adding or updating tests" --color "d4c5f9"
gh label create "type: infrastructure" --description "Infrastructure/tooling changes" --color "ededed"

# Priority labels (how urgent)
gh label create "priority: critical" --description "Must be fixed immediately" --color "b60205"
gh label create "priority: high" --description "High priority" --color "d93f0b"
gh label create "priority: medium" --description "Medium priority" --color "fbca04"
gh label create "priority: low" --description "Low priority" --color "0e8a16"

# Status labels (workflow state)
gh label create "status: ready" --description "Ready for development" --color "0e8a16"
gh label create "status: blocked" --description "Blocked by dependency" --color "d93f0b"
gh label create "status: in-progress" --description "Currently being worked on" --color "fbca04"
gh label create "status: review" --description "In code review" --color "0075ca"

# Area labels (what part of system)
gh label create "area: frontend" --description "Frontend code" --color "5319e7"
gh label create "area: backend" --description "Backend code" --color "1d76db"
gh label create "area: infrastructure" --description "Infrastructure/DevOps" --color "ededed"
gh label create "area: security" --description "Security-related" --color "b60205"
gh label create "area: testing" --description "Testing infrastructure" --color "d4c5f9"

# Flag labels (special considerations - align with GODMODE risk flags)
gh label create "flag: security-sensitive" --description "Requires security review" --color "b60205"
gh label create "flag: performance-critical" --description "Performance impact" --color "d93f0b"
gh label create "flag: breaking-change" --description "Breaking API change" --color "d93f0b"
gh label create "flag: ai-generated" --description "Code generated by AI" --color "0e8a16"
```

## Creating Issues from Plan

### Automated Flow (via /create-issues)

1. **Identify your target project** (one-time setup):
   ```bash
   # List all your projects and note the EXACT title you want
   gh project list --owner OWNER

   # Example output:
   # 3  Claude Agent Protocol         open  PVT_kwHOBGF6h84BJbD_
   # 2  Small Business Automation     open  PVT_kwHOBGF6h84BJbAN
   #
   # Copy the exact TITLE for use in commands below
   ```

2. **Ensure plan is saved** (GODMODE does this automatically):
   ```bash
   # Plans are initially saved to docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-type-feature-name-plan.md
   # Example: docs/plans/2026-02-04-standard-user-authentication-plan.md
   ls docs/plans/
   ```

3. **Generate issues** from approved plan:
   ```bash
   # In Claude Code session after plan approval
   /create-issues docs/plans/2026-02-04-standard-user-authentication-plan.md
   ```

4. **Command outputs** markdown for each issue with metadata

5. **Create first issue** using gh CLI with **exact project title**:
   ```bash
   # IMPORTANT: Use the EXACT project title to specify which board
   # Be explicit to ensure issues go to the intended project

   gh issue create \
     --title "Implement User Authentication Service" \
     --body-file issue-1.md \
     --label "type: feature" \
     --label "priority: high" \
     --label "area: backend" \
     --label "flag: security-sensitive" \
     --project "Claude Agent Protocol" \
     --assignee @me  # or leave unassigned for backlog
   ```

   **Important notes:**
   - Use the exact project title (case-sensitive)
   - Auto-add workflows may still add issues to other projects
   - Verify issue placement with: `gh issue view ISSUE_NUMBER --json projectItems`

6. **Rename plan to include issue number:**
   ```bash
   # After first issue created, note the issue number (e.g., #123)
   # Rename plan file to prepend issue number
   mv docs/plans/2026-02-04-standard-user-authentication-plan.md \
      docs/plans/123-2026-02-04-standard-user-authentication-plan.md

   # Update the issue to reference renamed file
   gh issue edit 123 --body "$(cat issue-1.md | sed 's|docs/plans/2026-02-04-standard-user-authentication-plan.md|docs/plans/123-2026-02-04-standard-user-authentication-plan.md|')"
   ```

   **Result:**
   - Plan filename now starts with issue number
   - Creates direct link between plan and GitHub issue
   - All future issues reference: `docs/plans/123-2026-02-04-standard-user-authentication-plan.md`

7. **Commit and push plan to repository:**
   ```bash
   # CRITICAL: Push plan to git so it's available to anyone picking up the issue
   git add docs/plans/123-2026-02-04-standard-user-authentication-plan.md
   git commit -m "docs: Add plan for user authentication (Issue #123)

   Generated plan for user authentication feature.
   Linked to issue #123.

   🤖 Generated with Claude Code"

   git push origin main  # or your current branch
   ```

   **Why this is critical:**
   - Without this, plan only exists on your local machine
   - Other developers can't see plan when picking up issue
   - You can't access plan in different sessions/machines
   - Issue references plan file path that won't exist in repo
   - Breaks team collaboration on backlog

8. **Create remaining issues** with updated plan reference

### Manual Label Assignment

Labels should be determined by issue characteristics:

| Characteristic | Labels |
|---------------|--------|
| New functionality | `type: feature` |
| Bug fix | `type: bug` |
| Code improvement | `type: enhancement` or `type: refactor` |
| Touches auth/data/APIs | `flag: security-sensitive` |
| Performance requirements | `flag: performance-critical` |
| Breaking API changes | `flag: breaking-change` |
| Plan Phase 1 | `priority: high` |
| Plan Phase 2+ | `priority: medium` or `priority: low` |

## Working with Project Boards

### View Project Board

```bash
# List all projects
gh project list --owner OWNER

# View specific project
gh project view 1 --owner OWNER

# Open project in browser
gh project view 1 --owner OWNER --web
```

### List Issues in Project

```bash
# List all items in project
gh project item-list 1 --owner OWNER

# Filter by status (requires custom fields setup)
gh project item-list 1 --owner OWNER --format json | jq '.items[] | select(.status=="Ready")'
```

### Check Project from Claude Code

You can query the project board during a session:

```bash
# See what's ready to work on
gh project item-list PROJECT_NUMBER --owner OWNER --format json | \
  jq -r '.items[] | select(.status=="Ready") | "Issue #\(.content.number): \(.content.title)"'
```

---

## Assigning Issues to Claude Code

### Option 1: Tag @claude (Immediate Assignment)

In the GitHub issue comment:
```
@claude please implement this following the GODMODE protocol
```

### Option 2: Pick from Board (Manual Assignment)

During Claude Code session:
```
# View ready issues
gh project item-list PROJECT_NUMBER --owner OWNER

# Reference in conversation
"Let's work on issue #123"
```

### Option 3: Auto-assign During Creation (Phase 0 Fork)

When creating issues, choose:
- **Immediate execution**: `--assignee @me` + start work in current session
- **Backlog mode**: No assignee, park in "Ready" column for later

---

## Picking Up Existing Issues from Backlog

**Scenario:** You have 10 issues in backlog, want to pick one and start implementing

**Workflow (Entry Point B in GODMODE):**

### Step 1: List Ready Issues

```bash
# View all ready issues in project
gh project item-list PROJECT_NUM --owner OWNER --format json | \
  jq -r '.items[] | "Issue #\(.content.number): \(.content.title) [\(.status.name)]"'

# Example output:
# Issue #45: Implement password hashing [Ready]
# Issue #46: Add user registration endpoint [Ready]
# Issue #47: Create login endpoint [Blocked]
```

### Step 2: Pick an Issue

In Claude Code session:
```
User: "Let's work on issue #45"
```

### Step 3: Load Issue Context

Claude automatically loads:
```bash
gh issue view 45 --json title,body,labels,projectItems
```

Extracts from issue:
- **Title**: What needs to be built
- **Description**: Why and context
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Definition of done
- **Technical Requirements**: How to build it
- **Testing Notes**: What tests are needed
- **Security/Performance Flags**: Check labels
- **Related Issues**: Check dependencies
- **Plan Reference**: Path to original plan (e.g., `docs/plans/123-2026-02-04-standard-user-auth-plan.md`)

### Step 4: Verify Readiness

Claude checks:
- [ ] Issue has clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] No blocking dependencies (related issues are closed)
- [ ] Technical requirements are understood
- [ ] Issue is not already assigned/in-progress

### Step 5: Restate and Confirm

Claude summarizes:
```
"I'll implement issue #45: Implement password hashing

Summary:
- Build bcrypt password hashing service
- hashPassword() and verifyPassword() functions
- Bcrypt rounds = 12
- Handle edge cases: null, empty, unicode

Labels: type: feature, flag: security-sensitive
→ Will run security review checklist

Acceptance criteria:
✓ hashPassword() returns bcrypt hash
✓ verifyPassword() validates correctly
✓ Edge cases tested

Dependencies: None

Ready to proceed?"
```

### Step 6: Setup Git Branch and Assign

Before implementation:

```bash
# 1. Assign issue to yourself
gh issue edit 45 --add-assignee @me

# 2. Create issue-specific branch
git checkout -b issue-45-password-hashing

# 3. Push branch to remote
git push -u origin issue-45-password-hashing

# 4. Comment on issue
gh issue comment 45 --body "🚧 Starting implementation on branch \`issue-45-password-hashing\`"
```

**Branch naming:**
- Format: `issue-NNN-brief-description`
- Example: `issue-45-password-hashing`
- Lowercase with hyphens

### Step 7: Jump to Phase 1

Claude skips Phase 0 (already planned) and goes straight to Phase 1:
- Implement code
- Run tests
- Security review (if flagged)
- Code review

### Step 8: Implement (Phase 1)

Claude implements the feature following GODMODE Phase 1:
- Write code following standards
- Generate tests (unit, integration, edge cases)
- Security review (if flagged)
- Code self-review

### Step 9: Commit Changes and Create PR

When implementation is complete:

```bash
# 1. Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat: Implement password hashing

- Add bcrypt-based hashPassword function
- Add verifyPassword function
- 15 unit tests covering edge cases

Closes #45

🤖 Generated with Claude Code (https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"

# 2. Push to remote branch
git push origin issue-45-password-hashing

# 3. Ask user for approval to create PR
# "Ready to create Pull Request? (yes/no)"

# 4. If approved, create PR
gh pr create \
  --title "feat: Implement password hashing (Closes #45)" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
Implements bcrypt-based password hashing for user authentication.

## Changes
- Add hashPassword function with bcrypt rounds = 12
- Add verifyPassword function
- 15 unit tests covering edge cases

## Testing
- ✅ Unit tests: 15/15 passing, 98% coverage
- ✅ Edge cases: Null, empty, unicode, max length
- ✅ Security review: OWASP checklist completed

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] hashPassword returns bcrypt hash
- [x] verifyPassword validates correctly
- [x] Edge cases tested

## Plan Reference
Source: `docs/plans/45-2025-11-29-standard-user-authentication-plan.md`

Closes #45

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
EOF
)" \
  --base main

# Output: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

**What happens next:**
- Issue #45 gets a link to PR in comments (automatic)
- When PR is merged, issue #45 auto-closes (via "Closes #45" keyword)
- Branch `issue-45-password-hashing` can be deleted after merge

### Step 10: Pick Next Issue

```bash
# List remaining ready issues
gh project item-list PROJECT_NUM --owner OWNER

# Continue with next
"Let's work on issue #46"
```

**Benefits:**
- No planning overhead (already done in Phase 0)
- All context in issue (self-contained)
- Quick context switching
- Visual progress on board
- Can work through backlog systematically

## GODMODE Integration Points

### Entry Point A: Phase 0, Step 6: Create Issues

After plan approval, the flow forks:

**Fork A: Immediate Execution**
1. `/create-issues prd.md`
2. Create issues with `--assignee @me`
3. Pick first issue and continue to Phase 1
4. Work through issues sequentially
5. Update project board status as you progress

**Fork B: Backlog Mode**
1. `/create-issues prd.md`
2. Create issues without assignee
3. Add to project "Ready" column
4. Exit GODMODE workflow
5. Issues live in backlog for later pickup (use Entry Point B to pick up)

### Entry Point B: Pick Existing Issue (Jump to Phase 1)

**When to use:** Later session, picking up issues from backlog created earlier

See detailed workflow in "Picking Up Existing Issues from Backlog" section above.

### Phase 1: Execution from Issues

**Applies to both:**
- Fork A: Working on first issue immediately after creation
- Entry Point B: Picking up existing issue from backlog

When working on an issue:

1. **Load issue context**:
   ```bash
   # View issue details
   gh issue view 123

   # Check related issues
   gh issue view 123 --json body | jq -r '.body' | grep "Related Issues"
   ```

2. **Verify dependencies**:
   - Check "Depends on" section
   - Ensure blocking issues are closed

3. **Follow GODMODE execution**:
   - Implement code
   - Run tests (TEST_STRATEGY.md)
   - Security review (if `flag: security-sensitive`)
   - Code review (AI_CODE_REVIEW.md)

4. **Update status**:
   ```bash
   # Add comment with progress
   gh issue comment 123 --body "Implementation complete. Running tests..."

   # Close when done
   gh issue close 123 --comment "All acceptance criteria met. Tests passing. Security review completed."
   ```

---

## Project Board Workflow

### Recommended Columns

1. **Backlog** - Issues not yet ready
2. **Ready** - Ready for development (acceptance criteria clear)
3. **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
4. **Review** - Code review / testing
5. **Done** - Completed and verified

### Status Updates

```bash
# Move issue between columns (requires project field setup)
gh project item-edit --project-id PROJECT_ID --id ITEM_ID --field-id FIELD_ID --value "In Progress"
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. One Issue = One PR
Each issue should map to a single, focused pull request.

### 2. Label Consistently
Always apply:
- Exactly one `type:` label
- Exactly one `priority:` label
- One or more `area:` labels
- Zero or more `flag:` labels

### 3. Link Issues
Use GitHub keywords in PR descriptions:
```markdown
Closes #123
Related to #124
Depends on #122
```

### 4. Update Status
Keep project board current:
- Move to "In Progress" when starting
- Move to "Review" when code complete
- Close issue when fully done (tests passing, reviewed, merged)

### 5. Reference Checklists
In issue comments, confirm completion:
```markdown
✅ Security Review Completed
- Reviewed: ~/.claude/checklists/AI_CODE_SECURITY_REVIEW.md
- All OWASP Top 10 items checked
- No vulnerabilities found

✅ Code Review Completed
- Reviewed: ~/.claude/checklists/AI_CODE_REVIEW.md
- Edge cases tested (null, empty, boundaries)
- Error handling verified
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Access Projects
```bash
# Re-authenticate with project scope
gh auth refresh -s project
```

### Project Not Found
```bash
# List all accessible projects
gh project list --owner OWNER

# Check repo's linked projects
gh repo view --json projectsV2
```

### Labels Not Applying
```bash
# Verify label exists
gh label list

# Create if missing (see Standard Label System above)
gh label create "type: feature" --color "a2eeef"
```

---

## Example End-to-End Flow

```bash
# 0. Identify your target project (one-time)
gh project list --owner austinbrowne
# Output: 3  Claude Agent Protocol  open  PVT_kwHOBGF6h84BJbD_
# Note the exact TITLE: "Claude Agent Protocol"

# 1. After plan approval in Phase 0
/create-issues docs/prd-user-auth.md

# 2. Create issues (Fork A: Immediate) - USE EXACT PROJECT TITLE
gh issue create --title "Implement password hashing" \
  --body-file issue-1-password-hashing.md \
  --label "type: feature,priority: high,area: backend,flag: security-sensitive" \
  --project "Claude Agent Protocol" \
  --assignee @me

# 3. Verify issue placement
gh issue view 45 --json projectItems
# Should show: {"projectItems":[{"title":"Claude Agent Protocol"}]}

# 4. Start work (Phase 1)
"Let's implement issue #45"

# 5. During implementation
gh issue comment 45 --body "Security review in progress..."

# 6. Complete issue
gh issue close 45 --comment "✅ Complete. Tests: 15/15 passing. Security review: PASSED"

# 7. Move to next issue
gh project item-list 3 --owner austinbrowne | grep "Ready"
```

---

## Integration with ADR

If issue involves architectural decisions:

1. Create ADR: `docs/adr/NNNN-title.md`
2. Reference in issue:
   ```bash
   gh issue comment 123 --body "Architecture decision documented in ADR-0005"
   ```
3. Link ADR in PR description
